Code for manuscript entitled "Experimental perturbations disentangle the effects of individual characteristics and social interactions on the emergence of rank"

Dominance rank systems can be conceptualized as a continuum from rank purely as an outcome of the individual’s phenotype to rank purely as an outcome of that individual’s social history in a group. Understanding where species fall on this rank continuum provides insight into the relative weight of individual characteristics versus social factors in determining an individual’s social standing in the group. Researchers often use simple correlations to study whether individual characteristics underly rank. When a weak or no correlation is found, this may not immediately mean that social factors are determining rank, because a cryptic individual characteristic not observed or measured by the human observer may still influence rank. Ideally, we need additional experimental manipulation of the social group (changes in group membership) to distinguish between rank systems. 

We used social manipulations in a captive group of monk parakeets, where we removed and reintroduced the top-ranked bird. Using this experimental approach, we tested whether rank was more based on individual characteristics or more on social processes. We found that body mass was not correlated with rank and that the previously top-ranked bird could not re-take its previous position in the group upon reintroduction. Using an experimental approach, we found that history of past interactions may be used over intrinsic characteristics to infer the rank of others in this group of monk parakeets.
